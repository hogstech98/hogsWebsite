When I'm not in class or with the house I like longboarding around campus, listening to music WAY too loudly (my favorite artists are Aries and MGK) and messing around with lighting/sound/set design for theater productions.

We're happy to help with most tech problems, and vocal supporters of Free and Open Source Software. I also play Tekken (buff Lars btw), and love talking fighting games or computer things in general.
